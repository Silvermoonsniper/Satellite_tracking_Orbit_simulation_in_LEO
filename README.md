# Satellite_tracking_Orbit_simulation_in_LEO
Orbit simulation for formation flying in LEO
Matlab codes for Master project at the university of Bremen, department of Communications engineering. 

Main contributions in this project are summarized as follows:
           1. Design a satellite orbit propagator in low earth orbit to simulate satellite motion with assistance of orbital elements
           2. Satellite motion simulation and transform on different frames. ECI frame, ECEF and LVLH frame.
           3. Satellite relative motion dynamics with HCW equations
           4. Kalman filter implementation based on HCW equations and sensor measurements for satellite position and velocity estimation to achieve satellite naviagation and optimal control
           5. The extensive investigation about Drag-modified HCW equations and J2-modified HCW equations, which involves perturbation of atmospheric drag force and earth flattening effect.
           6. Extended Kalman filter implementation based on these modified HCW equation and sensor measurements for satellite position and velocity estimation  under above mentioned perturbations
